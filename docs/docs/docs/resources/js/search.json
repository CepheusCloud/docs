[[{"l":"Introduction","p":["Welcome, this is the place where you can learn more about Cepheus","Cepheus is a decentralized platform that allows its users to earn a diversified basket of tokens by holding its dynamic NFT (dNFT). dNFTs have properties that can evolve over time in contrast to standard NFTs with unchanging traits. This new NFT primitive allows your Cepheus dNFTs to gain more use-cases and a more diversified basket of token rewards the longer you hold it. Unlike normal NFTs, your Cepheus dNFTs grow alongside you. Holding our dNFTs gives you full access to the entire gamut of benefits listed below.","The Cepheus foundation and the community believe that a decentralized contribution platform is required to democratize the potential of each blockchain. The token holders are decision-makers of the Cepheus protocol; they decide where they contribute, how much they contribute, and who is allowed to integrate with the protocol.","Cepheus is unlocking the power of decentralized contributions for everyone by creating an inclusive platform for Web3 empowerment, enabling everyone with equal access to contribute and get incentivized."]}],[{"l":"Protocol","p":["Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is based on the peer-to-peer concept that removes intermediaries from the system. By relying on peer-to-peer philosophy and self-executing “smart contracts” on the blockchain network, DeFi democratizes finance and replaces traditional centralized institutions such as banks, brokerages, and NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies).","Contributors of the protocol can communicate with our smart contracts using their wallets to contribute to a blockchain, claim rewards, enable generative wealth incentives and participate in on-chain governance. Contributors with voting rights can also vote to enable algorithmic trading strategies, integrate the protocol with yield programs and so forth. To increase the treasury of the protocol, this is a huge benefit for the contributors.","The Cepheus protocol is managed by people around the world who hold its governance token. Through a proven system, inspired by Compound, users make on-chain decisions to improve the protocol over time.","The protocol is built modularly; each component has its purpose and contributes to a sustainable protocol. This is how the protocol would look like from a high-level overview:","Protocol Overview"]},{"l":"Fees","p":["The fees generated from the interface will be used to increase the rewards pools. Therefore, each contributor receives more rewards in a sustainable way."]}],[{"l":"Interface","p":["Advanced exploit identification and mitigation","All solutions have been audited","Anti-frontrunning bots","Audited token contracts","Deploy audited and battle-tested token contracts, don’t waste money and time on this","Governance","Launch your NFT collection and get it staked on your own platform","Launch your off- or on-chain governance protocol","Launch your own token gated community","Launch your own token staking solutions; compounding, multi-asset etc.","Launch your token and block bots from stealing retail liquidity","Liquidity management protocol (LMP)","Monitor and track transactions from your token and block malicious activities","NFT marketplace","NFT staking","Sell, buy, mint NFTs via your own NFT marketplace","The benefits of the interface:","The interface automatically scales","The interface is accessible to anyone","The interface is reliable and fast due to the underlying node infrastructure","The interface revs the growth of Web3 businesses","The list with solutions will grow by closing new partnerships.","The solutions are battle-tested","The underlying node infrastructure is used to connect with the blockchain and deploy solutions.","This protocol can be implemented on any EVM blockchain; the protocol will automatically scale/downscale the liquidity pool and create a price range that can be set by the team","This section is divided into three parts. The first will define what an interface is and classify different types. It will then introduce the concept of 'decentralized dApp deployments.'","Token gated communities","Token protection","Token staking","Token vesting","Vest tokens of investors, advisors, and even team members.","We've developed two different versions; an interface that communicates with browsers and applications and an interface that communicates with smart contracts. The version that interacts with smart contracts is used to integrate with technical partners. These partners provide audited blockchain solutions that help individuals and Web3 businesses build their token economy. Most solutions consist of both smart contracts and user interfaces.","We’ve heard from many blockchain enthusiasts, founders, and business leaders that blockchain solutions require a lot of resources. To build your own token economy you will need 2-3 developers, a few months to develop the utilities, get contracts audited and so on. We simplified this, and we’ve made it a lot cheaper. This is a game changer. The interface will change the way we build Web3 businesses and real-world applications.","You can think of the following solutions:","You can use an interface to authenticate, settle with, test, and deploy solutions. The interface is like an API, mainly an address you can use in your browser, your dApp, and our platform."]},{"l":"Integrations","p":["The protocol automatically scales by integrating the interface with third-party blockchain solutions. Every Web3 business would be able to connect their blockchain app with the interface and gain access to a large community, potentially a large group of users.","However, the integration needs to be tested by software developers, the solution must be audited by an audit company, and the community needs to vote.","These integrations generate revenue for the foundation; every deployment will cost a fee, the fee is paid by the initiator who wants the solution, the partner who built the solution will get paid a flat fee. This model is scalable and can be changed by on-chain governance proposals in the future."]},{"l":"Fees","p":["The interface will generate revenue by receiving fees for its usage. Businesses that integrate with the interface will pay fees; those fees will be accepted in stablecoins and sent to the treasury.","The treasury automatically distributes the collected fees to the ADRS system, and ADRS monitors the liquidity management protocol (LMP) and staking vaults. ADRS will automatically fund these vaults.","Interface fees"]}],[{"l":"Governance","p":["In addition to being a standard ERC-20 asset, CEPH allows the owner to delegate voting rights to the address of their choice; the owner’s wallet, another user, an application, or a DeFi expert. Anybody can participate in Cepheus governance by receiving delegation, without needing to own CEPH.","The token also includes code to query an address’ historical voting weight, which is useful for building complex voting systems.","We use a simple governance framework so that you can easily participate in shaping the direction of Cepheus. Here’s how it works:","All proposals are subject to a 6 day voting period, and any address with voting power can vote for or against the proposal. If a majority, and at least 250,000 votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented after 2 days.","Governance Process","The transition to community governance will be managed with a relentless focus on security & stability, and will follow the principle of increasing decentralization."]}],[{"l":"Contributions","p":["We believe in automated decentralized reward systems (ADRS). With this system, you could incentivize contributors transparently and continuously. The protocol uses ADRS to reward contributors for their effort in securing the blockchain, providing liquidity to enable sustainability and the tokenization of all assets.","The protocol scales automatically by integrations with Web3 businesses; the treasuries will automatically grow and increase the given rewards. This means contributors will benefit from the protocol; by contributing to the protocol, they will receive the rewards it generates.","The rewards can be staked or used on the platform. When users stake their rewards, they essentially contribute to the protocol and increase the network's security. In return, they earn perks and voting power for their contributions."]},{"l":"Categories","p":["The users contribute by managing nodes, participating in the governance system, setting up integrations with wealth generators, and so on.","The partners contribute by integrating their solutions with the interface. They will receive a fee for each solution deployment. A portion of the revenue will be sent to the protocol that distributes it to the rewarding system.","Algorithmic trading is a process for executing orders utilizing automated and pre-programmed trading instructions to account for variables such as price, timing and volume. The profit will be used to fund the vaults via ADRS.","We'll add more categories continuously."]}],[{"l":"dNFT-as-a-Service"},{"l":"Introduction","p":["After achieving widespread adoption throughout the Web3 community, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are making their way into the mainstream, with spotlights in major media outlets and a series of high-profile athletes and public figures launching their own collections. As a result, NFTs have become one of the most publicly prominent applications of blockchain technology.","The next step in the evolution of NFTs is just getting started. Dynamic NFTs (dNFTs) are expanding the design space that NFTs are able to address through their ability to adapt and change in response to external events and data."]},{"l":"History of NFTs","p":["In a nutshell, NFTs are unique digital objects that exist on a blockchain. Every NFT can be differentiated from another through a 1-of-1 tokenID and its unique contract address. From there, metadata such as images, video files, or other data can be attached, meaning that it’s possible to own a token that represents a unique digital object."]},{"l":"The need","p":["Static NFTs are currently the most common type of NFT, used for the most part by NFT art projects, metaverses and play-to-earn game projects and as digital collectibles. Beyond these use cases, they also offer a unique value proposition for digitizing items in the real world, such as real estate deeds, patents, and other unique identifiers."]},{"l":"Limitations","p":["However, this model is limited by the permanence of static NFTs, because the metadata attached to them is fixed once they’re minted on a blockchain. Use cases such as tokenizing real-world assets, building progression-based video games, or creating blockchain-based fantasy sports leagues often require data to be updated. dNFTs offer a best-of-both-worlds approach, with NFTs retaining their unique identifiers while able to update aspects of their metadata."]},{"l":"Implementation","p":["Put simply, a dynamic NFT is an NFT that can change based on external conditions. Change in a dynamic NFT often refers to changes in the NFT’s metadata triggered by a smart contract. This is done by encoding automatic changes within the NFT smart contract, which provides instructions to the underlying NFT regarding when and how its metadata should change.","dNFTs can be upgraded in multiple ways based on external conditions","Dynamic elements besides metadata changes can also exist. For example, dynamic NFTs can be minted based on certain conditions, such as when a hidden spot is found in an augmented reality application. Dynamic NFTs can also house “hidden traits” manifested through user interactions instead of within the metadata. As fully unique and customizable tokens, NFTs can be programmed in an infinite number of ways. However, most dynamic NFTs must implement some form of metadata change in order for non-technical users to “see” the changes."]},{"l":"Infrastructure","p":["We designed an infrastructure that is accessible and easy to use by Web3 projects in any form. The dNFT service can integrate with on-chain and off-chain systems, such as smart contracts and backend systems.","We leverage the scalable services from Amazon AWS, which means there are zero limitations from the technical perspective. It is essential for play-to-earn games and metaverses where you do not want a latency between user interaction and updating NFT traits.","The infrastructure consists of the following components:","On-chain database","Off-chain database","REST API","On-chain API (smart contract)","Monitoring system (displays statistics)"]},{"l":"SDK","p":["The SDK is a set of tools, libraries, relevant documentation, code samples, processes and guides that allow you to build applications and connect with our infrastructure. It has never been so easy to deploy dNFTs."]},{"l":"Potential Use Cases","p":["NFT metadata is where the token’s name is specified, traits are assigned, and file links are placed. While the tokenID provides a permanent identifier for verifiable ownership, the metadata is the essence of the NFT—housing the elements that make it useful.","Generative NFT art projects often have a variety of traits, with some rarer than others. These traits are placed within an NFT’s metadata alongside an IPFS link to an image or video that corresponds to the NFT’s traits. In a dNFT, these traits change based on external conditions."]},{"l":"Example use cases","p":["This functionality can be useful for character progression—a core tenet of many different game models—in blockchain games. When first starting a game with a playable NFT character, the NFT has base stats reflected in its metadata. As the player continues leveling up, the metadata in the NFT changes to reflect the character’s growth.","Another case where metadata changes are useful is in the tokenization of virtual assets, where a host of changing metrics are often required. For example, an NFT representing a property could reflect its maintenance history, age, market value, and more. Tokenizing these changing assets therefore requires NFTs which have the ability to update with changing metadata."]}],[{"l":"Investment fund","p":["Cepheus DeFi investment fund. Through our fund, we look forward to working with the industry’s finest, towards a bright future. Cepheus Ventures invests in tech startups at all stages of development, with a preference towards NFTs.

It should be easy to contribute to blockchains. We've developed a platform where anyone can contribute to blockchains differently. The core component of the platform is the node infrastructure. The node infrastructure consists of hundreds or even thousands of nodes owned by contributors.","A node can be purchased, managed, leased, and transferred via the blockchain. As a contributor, you can choose to make your node available to everyone or just for yourself. The node can only be used to communicate with the blockchain; malicious actors can't steal your funds. You will receive additional rewards if you allow unknown sources to use your node. Technically speaking, your node will be added to a cluster accessible via a load-balancer.
