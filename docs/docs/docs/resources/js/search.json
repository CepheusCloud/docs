[[{"l":"Introduction","p":["Welcome, this is the place where you can learn more about Cepheus","Cepheus is a decentralized platform that allows its users to earn a diversified basket of tokens by holding its dynamic NFT (dNFT). dNFTs have properties that can evolve over time in contrast to standard NFTs with unchanging traits. This new NFT primitive allows your Cepheus dNFTs to gain more use-cases and a more diversified basket of token rewards the longer you hold it. Unlike normal NFTs, your Cepheus dNFTs grow alongside you. Holding our dNFTs gives you full access to the entire gamut of benefits listed below.","The Cepheus foundation and the community believe that a decentralized contribution platform is required to democratize the potential of each blockchain. The token holders are decision-makers of the Cepheus protocol; they decide where they contribute, how much they contribute, and who is allowed to integrate with the protocol.","Cepheus is unlocking the power of decentralized contributions for everyone by creating an inclusive platform for Web3 empowerment, enabling everyone with equal access to contribute and get incentivized."]}],[{"l":"dNFT-as-a-Service","p":["Learn more about dNFTs before you continue"]},{"l":"Introduction","p":["Businesses are struggling to incorporate NFTs and stay relevant in the wave of blockchain, metaverse, and Web3 dominating the traditional ways. However, with this being said, NFTs have already become a mainstream phenomenon. This tendency can be explained by the growing number of influencers involved, the emergence of new gaming communities, and the increasing demand for digital art. In terms of gaining traction, businesses can have their own in-house NFT marketplace or they can leverage any existing NFT as a Service (NFTaaS)."]},{"l":"What we offer","p":["We follow the same model as BaaS by letting companies use cloud-based networks and services to build and manage their own NFT applications. The cost of setting up an NFT application is a lot, and many companies cannot afford to be self-sufficient. Are you one of them?","You don’t need to build your own infrastructure/application to get it done when you can get our dNFT-as-a-Service that in exchange for a monthly subscription fee. We offer you tools and infrastructure to launch your own dNFT project, within a day."]},{"l":"How does it work","p":["Put simply, a dynamic NFT is an NFT that can change based on external conditions. Change in a dynamic NFT often refers to changes in the NFT’s metadata triggered by a smart contract. This is done by encoding automatic changes within the NFT smart contract, which provides instructions to the underlying NFT regarding when and how its metadata should change.","dNFTs can be upgraded in multiple ways based on external conditions","Dynamic elements besides metadata changes can also exist. For example, dynamic NFTs can be minted based on certain conditions, such as when a hidden spot is found in an augmented reality application. Dynamic NFTs can also house “hidden traits” manifested through user interactions instead of within the metadata. As fully unique and customizable tokens, NFTs can be programmed in an infinite number of ways. However, most dynamic NFTs must implement some form of metadata change in order for non-technical users to “see” the changes."]},{"l":"Infrastructure","p":["We designed an infrastructure that is accessible and easy to use by Web3 projects in any form. The dNFT service can be easily integrated with your existing dApp(s).","We leverage the scalable services from cloud providers, these cloud providers help us scale and deliver high performance loading speed of your dNFTs. It is essential for play-to-earn games and metaverses where you do not want a latency between user interaction and updating NFT traits.","The infrastructure consists of the following components:","Smart contracts","REST API","Caching (NFT images)","Monitoring system (displays statistics)"]},{"l":"SDK","p":["The SDK is a set of tools, libraries, relevant documentation, code samples, processes and guides that allow you to build applications and connect with our infrastructure. It has never been so easy to deploy dNFTs."]},{"l":"Potential Use Cases","p":["NFT metadata is where the token’s name is specified, traits are assigned, and file links are placed. While the tokenID provides a permanent identifier for verifiable ownership, the metadata is the essence of the NFT—housing the elements that make it useful.","Generative NFT art projects often have a variety of traits, with some rarer than others. These traits are placed within an NFT’s metadata alongside an IPFS link to an image or video that corresponds to the NFT’s traits. In a dNFT, these traits change based on external conditions."]},{"l":"Example use cases","p":["This functionality can be useful for character progression—a core tenet of many different game models—in blockchain games. When first starting a game with a playable NFT character, the NFT has base stats reflected in its metadata. As the player continues leveling up, the metadata in the NFT changes to reflect the character’s growth.","Another case where metadata changes are useful is in the tokenization of virtual assets, where a host of changing metrics are often required. For example, an NFT representing a property could reflect its maintenance history, age, market value, and more. Tokenizing these changing assets therefore requires NFTs which have the ability to update with changing metadata."]}],[{"l":"Introduction and Utilities","p":["The NFT sale starts in November! Join our Discord channel to get the latest updates.","NFTs are digital assets that people can own on the blockchain. Contrary to popular belief, NFTs are more than jpegs you can screenshot. The underlying code for each NFT is unique and cannot be duplicated.","Normal NFTs are static - their properties don’t change overtime. This actually limits the use-cases for what NFTs can do, because normal NFTs are unable to evolve or improve with time. Their properties are fixed."]},{"l":"dNFTs","p":["After achieving widespread adoption throughout the Web3 community, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are making their way into the mainstream, with spotlights in major media outlets and a series of high-profile athletes and public figures launching their own collections. As a result, NFTs have become one of the most publicly prominent applications of blockchain technology.","The next step in the evolution of NFTs is just getting started. Dynamic NFTs (dNFTs) are expanding the design space that NFTs are able to address through their ability to adapt and change in response to external events and data."]},{"l":"The need","p":["Static NFTs are currently the most common type of NFT, used for the most part by NFT art projects, metaverses and play-to-earn game projects and as digital collectibles. Beyond these use cases, they also offer a unique value proposition for digitizing items in the real world, such as real estate deeds, patents, and other unique identifiers."]},{"l":"Limitations","p":["However, this model is limited by the permanence of static NFTs, because the metadata attached to them is fixed once they’re minted on a blockchain. Use cases such as tokenizing real-world assets, building progression-based video games, or creating blockchain-based fantasy sports leagues often require data to be updated. dNFTs offer a best-of-both-worlds approach, with NFTs retaining their unique identifiers while able to update aspects of their metadata."]},{"l":"Our Utilities","p":["Access","Algo funds","Boosts","But in terms of rewards - $CEPH tokens aren’t all you get!","But this isn’t an NFT that just changes cosmetically and only gives you rewards: each evolution of Cepheus dNFts unlocks more use-cases for you with every upcoming iteration.","Cepheus dNFTs are Yield-Bearing.

They provide token holders with certain rights that influence a protocol’s direction. This could include which new products or features to develop, how to spend a budget, which integrations or partnerships should be pursued, such as yield programs and more.","Generally speaking, exercising this influence can take two forms. First, governance token holders can propose changes through a formal proposal submission process. If certain criteria are met and the proposal goes to a vote, governance token holders can use their NFTs to vote on the proposed changes. The specific mechanisms and processes through which these rights are exercised differ across protocols.","This is how a governance meetup in the Metaverse will look like:","Virtual Governance Session"]},{"l":"Metaverse","p":["Outside of rewards, your Cepheus dNFT also gives you access to the Cepheus Space, where you get access to Cepheus Merchandise at discounted prices.","You can also host virtual meetups with your Astronaut in here!"]}],[{"l":"Collections","p":["✅ 130 days ROI","✅ 170 days ROI","✅ 240 days ROI","✅ Accumulate projec tokens","✅ Daily staking rewards","✅ Get access to private token sale","✅ Governance power","✅ Participate in Algo funds","✅ Participate in venture fund","✅ Receive perks from partners","Our NFT collections are an assortment of digital assets containing a limited number of individual NFTs.

It has never been so easy to participate in an ecosystem and get rewarded."]},{"l":"How does it work","p":["Yield farming is one field of DeFi that allows crypto investors to earn rewards by moving their tokens to yield-generating smart contracts. In this process, the investor is the liquidity provider (LP), and the liquidity pool is a cash-filled smart contract.","The yield farming process typically expects participants to lock up or stake their funds, and yield aggregators work by automating the farming process to produce the highest yields possible. Let’s see how this system works in detail.","Yield aggregators combine the investments of various farmers (crypto investors) to facilitate profits earning using different strategies while remaining idle and waiting to accumulate passive income since the automated service provided by yield aggregators does it all for them.","This is how the process looks like: Yield farming Overview","The protocol automatically compounds the rewards from yield aggregators and distributes a portion to the algorithmic trading fund.","Using these strategies, participants can move tokens around different platforms, optimizing yields via auto-compounding. This process allows stakers to claim and restake their rewards without the need to do it manually."]}],[{"l":"Protocol","p":["Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is based on the peer-to-peer concept that removes intermediaries from the system.
