[[{"l":"Introduction","p":["Welcome, this is the place where you can learn more about Cepheus","Cepheus is a decentralized platform dedicated to bringing contributions to the token economy. The Cepheus protocol employs an automated rewards system. The first being, Ceph, a token used to contribute to both Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions, increases the stability and empowers Web3. The protocol will be operational on both Polygon and Avalanche and automatically scale to more blockchains.","The Cepheus foundation and the community believe that a decentralized contribution platform is required to democratize the potential of each blockchain. The token holders are decision-makers of the Cepheus protocol; they decide where they contribute, how much they contribute, and who is allowed to integrate with the protocol.","Cepheus is unlocking the power of decentralized contributions for everyone by creating an inclusive platform for Web3 empowerment, enabling everyone with equal access to contribute and get incentivized."]}],[{"l":"Protocol","p":["Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is based on the peer-to-peer concept that removes intermediaries from the system. By relying on peer-to-peer philosophy and self-executing “smart contracts” on the blockchain network, DeFi democratizes finance and replaces traditional centralized institutions such as banks, brokerages, and NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies).","Contributors of the protocol can communicate with our smart contracts using their wallets to contribute to a blockchain, claim rewards, enable generative wealth incentives and participate in on-chain governance. Contributors with voting rights can also vote to enable algorithmic trading strategies, integrate the protocol with yield programs and so forth. To increase the treasury of the protocol, this is a huge benefit for the contributors.","The Cepheus protocol is managed by people around the world who hold its governance token. Through a proven system, inspired by Compound, users make on-chain decisions to improve the protocol over time.","The protocol is built modularly; each component has its purpose and contributes to a sustainable protocol. This is how the protocol would look like from a high-level overview:","Protocol Overview"]},{"l":"Fees","p":["The fees generated from the interface will be used to increase the rewards pools. Therefore, each contributor receives more rewards in a sustainable way."]}],[{"l":"Interface","p":["Advanced exploit identification and mitigation","All solutions have been audited","Anti-frontrunning bots","Audited token contracts","Deploy audited and battle-tested token contracts, don’t waste money and time on this","Governance","Launch your NFT collection and get it staked on your own platform","Launch your off- or on-chain governance protocol","Launch your own token gated community","Launch your own token staking solutions; compounding, multi-asset etc.","Launch your token and block bots from stealing retail liquidity","Liquidity management protocol (LMP)","Monitor and track transactions from your token and block malicious activities","NFT marketplace","NFT staking","Sell, buy, mint NFTs via your own NFT marketplace","The benefits of the interface:","The interface automatically scales","The interface is accessible to anyone","The interface is reliable and fast due to the underlying node infrastructure","The interface revs the growth of Web3 businesses","The list with solutions will grow by closing new partnerships.","The solutions are battle-tested","The underlying node infrastructure is used to connect with the blockchain and deploy solutions.","This protocol can be implemented on any EVM blockchain; the protocol will automatically scale/downscale the liquidity pool and create a price range that can be set by the team","This section is divided into three parts. The first will define what an interface is and classify different types. It will then introduce the concept of 'decentralized dApp deployments.'","Token gated communities","Token protection","Token staking","Token vesting","Vest tokens of investors, advisors, and even team members.","We've developed two different versions; an interface that communicates with browsers and applications and an interface that communicates with smart contracts. The version that interacts with smart contracts is used to integrate with technical partners. These partners provide audited blockchain solutions that help individuals and Web3 businesses build their token economy. Most solutions consist of both smart contracts and user interfaces.","We’ve heard from many blockchain enthusiasts, founders, and business leaders that blockchain solutions require a lot of resources. To build your own token economy you will need 2-3 developers, a few months to develop the utilities, get contracts audited and so on. We simplified this, and we’ve made it a lot cheaper. This is a game changer. The interface will change the way we build Web3 businesses and real-world applications.","You can think of the following solutions:","You can use an interface to authenticate, settle with, test, and deploy solutions. The interface is like an API, mainly an address you can use in your browser, your dApp, and our platform."]},{"l":"Integrations","p":["The protocol automatically scales by integrating the interface with third-party blockchain solutions. Every Web3 business would be able to connect their blockchain app with the interface and gain access to a large community, potentially a large group of users.","However, the integration needs to be tested by software developers, the solution must be audited by an audit company, and the community needs to vote.","These integrations generate revenue for the foundation; every deployment will cost a fee, the fee is paid by the initiator who wants the solution, the partner who built the solution will get paid a flat fee. This model is scalable and can be changed by on-chain governance proposals in the future."]},{"l":"Fees","p":["The interface will generate revenue by receiving fees for its usage. Businesses that integrate with the interface will pay fees; those fees will be accepted in stablecoins and sent to the treasury.","The treasury automatically distributes the collected fees to the ADRS system, and ADRS monitors the liquidity management protocol (LMP) and staking vaults. ADRS will automatically fund these vaults.","Interface fees"]}],[{"l":"Governance","p":["In addition to being a standard ERC-20 asset, CEPH allows the owner to delegate voting rights to the address of their choice; the owner’s wallet, another user, an application, or a DeFi expert. Anybody can participate in Cepheus governance by receiving delegation, without needing to own CEPH.","The token also includes code to query an address’ historical voting weight, which is useful for building complex voting systems.","We use a simple governance framework so that you can easily participate in shaping the direction of Cepheus. Here’s how it works:","All proposals are subject to a 6 day voting period, and any address with voting power can vote for or against the proposal. If a majority, and at least 250,000 votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented after 2 days.","Governance Process","The transition to community governance will be managed with a relentless focus on security & stability, and will follow the principle of increasing decentralization."]}],[{"l":"Contributions","p":["We believe in automated decentralized reward systems (ADRS). With this system, you could incentivize contributors transparently and continuously. The protocol uses ADRS to reward contributors for their effort in securing the blockchain, providing liquidity to enable sustainability and the tokenization of all assets.","The protocol scales automatically by integrations with Web3 businesses; the treasuries will automatically grow and increase the given rewards. This means contributors will benefit from the protocol; by contributing to the protocol, they will receive the rewards it generates.","The rewards can be staked or used on the platform. When users stake their rewards, they essentially contribute to the protocol and increase the network's security. In return, they earn perks and voting power for their contributions."]},{"l":"Categories","p":["The users contribute by managing nodes, participating in the governance system, setting up integrations with wealth generators, and so on.","The partners contribute by integrating their solutions with the interface. They will receive a fee for each solution deployment. A portion of the revenue will be sent to the protocol that distributes it to the rewarding system.","Algorithmic trading is a process for executing orders utilizing automated and pre-programmed trading instructions to account for variables such as price, timing and volume. The profit will be used to fund the vaults via ADRS.","We'll add more categories continuously."]}],[{"l":"Nodes","p":["Even though there are many Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchains, many of them don't respect true decentralization.","We will revolutionize and democratize the way people contribute to blockchains. It should be easy to contribute to blockchains. We've developed a platform where anyone can contribute to blockchains differently. The core component of the platform is the node infrastructure. The node infrastructure consists of hundreds or even thousands of nodes owned by contributors.","A node can be purchased, managed, leased, and transferred via the blockchain. As a contributor, you can choose to make your node available to everyone or just for yourself. The node can only be used to communicate with the blockchain; malicious actors can't steal your funds. You will receive additional rewards if you allow unknown sources to use your node. Technically speaking, your node will be added to a cluster accessible via a load-balancer. The load balancer is distributed across two different continents.","Everyone would be able to connect with the node infrastructure and use those nodes to build their dApps. Unmetered.","The node infrastructure is an important piece of the protocol. The node infrastructure will be developed in three different phases:","Nodes Implementation Phases","Initial launch: the node infrastructure will automatically scale by using multiple cloud services and connecting with our nodes","Cepheus infrastructure: the entire infrastructure will be managed by Cepheus","External infrastructure: in this stage, it would be possible for anyone to connect their node with the protocol and receive rewards for contributing"]},{"i":"dynamic-nfts-dnfts","l":"Dynamic NFTs (dNFTs)","p":["Dynamic NFTs (dNFTs) are expanding the design space that NFTs are able to address through their ability to adapt and change in response to external events and data.","Each node represents an NFT.

This could be anything from being a virtual ticket to an event to being a digital collectible that can be used in a game or metaverse. We use utility NFTs in our ecosystem. Each NFT has its own traits; those traits give the NFT value.","What makes our NFTs so unique? Well, not because they are Non-fungible. These non-fungible tokens can shift and mutate over time according to programmable features embedded in our ecosystem.","The properties change based on data pulled from on-chain actions in our platform. The following properties have influence on the value of each NFT:","Properties","Access","Token gated access (virtual meetups, board meetings), yield pool, algo pool","Boosts","Reward boost, governance boost","Ownership","Own a node","Partners","Receive perks from partners (free audits etc.)"]},{"l":"Governance","p":["NFTs represent ownership in a decentralized protocol. They provide token holders with certain rights that influence a protocol’s direction. This could include which new products or features to develop, how to spend a budget, which integrations or partnerships should be pursued, such as yield programs and more.","Generally speaking, exercising this influence can take two forms. First, governance token holders can propose changes through a formal proposal submission process. If certain criteria are met and the proposal goes to a vote, governance token holders can use their NFTs to vote on the proposed changes. The specific mechanisms and processes through which these rights are exercised differ across protocols.","This is how a governance meetup in the Metaverse will look like:","Virtual Governance Session"]},{"l":"Contributing","p":["There are a few ways to contribute to blockchains.
