[[{"l":"Introduction","p":["Welcome, this is the place where you can learn more about Cepheus","At its core, Cepheus is composed of two primary parts that work together in conjunction:","The Space Station- a platform that helps new projects build out their Web3 infrastructure that acts as one of several revenue sources for the Cepheus Protocol.","Cepheus dNFTs- that reward holders in a variety of different ways and tokens, including the $CEPH token, which is needed to use the Space Station.","Cepheus is as much a platform for builders as it is for holders. In the subsequent sections, we’ll take a deep dive into how these two parts work together to create a platform that can scale sustainably by leveraging the dynamic nature of dNFTs to give holders more rewards and more use-cases as time passes.","The Cepheus protocol is managed by people around the world who hold its governance token. Through a proven system, inspired by Compound, users make on-chain decisions to improve the protocol over time.","Protocol","The protocol is built modularly; each component has its purpose and contributes to a sustainable protocol. This is how the protocol would look like from a high-level overview:","Protocol Overview"]}],[{"l":"What are DNFTs"},{"l":"NFTs","p":["NFTs are digital assets that people can own on the blockchain, but “owning” an NFT has a very different connotation to owning normal crypto tokens. Unlike standard crypto tokens, each NFTs has its own individual underlying code which in turn makes each NFT unique to one another - even within the same collection. It’s this property of individual uniqueness (or non-fungibility) that gives NFTs a lot of their collector value."]},{"l":"Non-Fungibility","p":["To highlight what this looks like in practice:","My 1 USDT is exactly the same as your 1 USDT, which is the same as any 1 USDT in circulation everywhere. To function as a form of currency, every standard crypto token is designed to be 1:1 interchangeable with one another, or fungible. They all function the same, no matter which specific token you hold from within that cryptocurrency.","However, my 1 NFT is different from your 1 NFT even if they are from the same collection - each of which are also different (and identifiable) from any other NFT in the same collection. Every single NFT has its own unique individual code, which then translates to each NFT having its own unique individual traits."]},{"l":"Traits","p":["Oftentimes, these traits found in an NFT’s unique code are visually represented. Unlike normal crypto tokens, NFTs aren’t just strings of immutable code. On top of their code, NFTs have accompanying images. This can be a piece of digital art or a PFP (Profile Picture) character.","My Bored Ape with red hair is different from your Bored Ape with blue hair, which are unique among the collection of 10,000 Bored Apes - because every single ape has a unique mix of different traits, which is why they all look different from one another!","Although standard crypto tokens can confer a sense of ownership, they cannot confer a sense of identity because they lack traits. This unique visual layer is the primary reason that NFTs have become so popular in the mainstream in a way that normal crypto tokens have not. NFT traits allow NFTs to become collectibles by dictating their rarity, price and functionality.","Traits are what makes NFTs feel special because after all, owning an NFT usually means you’re holding a one-of-a-kind image. Contrary to popular belief, NFTs are more than jpegs you can screenshot, simply because the underlying code for each NFT is unique and cannot be duplicated. Screenshotting an NFT is taking an image without being able to use any of its coded functionality."]},{"l":"Adoption","p":["Prior to NFTs becoming popular, crypto was viewed as a playground for monetary experiments facilitated by emerging tech - not exactly relatable to a lot of people by a large margin.","However, everybody understands what a picture, character or a collectible is. Everyone also has their own unique sense of visual taste, which NFTs (with their traits) accommodate perfectly.","As a result of having unique (trait-driven) imagery, NFTs have become collectible, memeable, relatable and usable to a greater segment of the population. Fashion, Sports, Art and Design are some of the industries that have been able to adopt and find use-cases for NFTs because anything that is rare and collectible in the real world can theoretically now be represented by an NFT."]},{"l":"The Problem","p":["NFTs are unique and defining - but they are static. In practical terms, this means that normal NFTs usually can’t undergo a “change of traits”, or gain functionality over time because the metadata attached to them is fixed once they’re minted on a blockchain.","Use cases such as tokenizing real-world assets, building progression-based video games, or creating blockchain-based fantasy sports leagues often require data to be updated, but the static nature of NFTs have instead limited them to only being collectibles or fun profile pictures.","The net result of this permanence is that standard static NFTs started to lose value as investments due to being unable to gain new functionality. NFTs then became the poster-children for what are considered to be depreciating Web3 assets, or “bad long term holds”. This is oftentimes a reason why the NFT market is referred to as a bubble that has popped. After all - why hold something that can’t do anything new?","What if there was a solution that leveraged the uniqueness and collectibility of normal NFTs, but included in them a mechanism for gaining functionality and growth?"]},{"l":"DNFTs","p":["Dynamic NFTs (dNFTs) are NFTs that each maintain their unique and non-fungible code while also having the ability to gain additional traits and functionality over time. The breakthrough that dNFTs bring is that they maintain the uniqueness in their code like traditional static NFTs, but are responsive to external events at the same time and are thus able to grow in functionality.","In other words, dNFTs still have their own unique underlying code that makes them special and identifiable, but their traits aren’t static. They can grow and evolve while still being unique, or non-fungible.","dNFTs are expanding the design space that NFTs are able to address through their ability to adapt and change in response to external events and data.","Imagine having a dNFT as a videogame character that can level up (and gain new functionality), or an architectural plan that can evolve to best fit the terrain on which the new structure can be built on.","If standard NFTs can represent anything that is static in the real world, dNFTs can represent anything that can evolve. The use-cases are essentially limitless!","Before we deep dive into how Cepheus uses dNFTs to reward its holders, we first need an overview of the protocol."]},{"l":"Utilities","p":["Access","Algo funds","Boosts","But in terms of rewards - $CEPH tokens aren’t all you get!","But this isn’t an NFT that just changes cosmetically and only gives you rewards: each evolution of Cepheus dNFts unlocks more use-cases for you with every upcoming iteration.","Cepheus dNFTs are Yield-Bearing.

As we’ve discussed in the last section, Platform Fees paid to the Space Station flow into the ADRS (Reward Pool) to be distributed as $CEPH Token rewards to dNFT Stakers.","But what is the $CEPH Token and what does it do?","Space Station Use- The $CEPH Token is a utility token that is needed to use the services on the Space Station.","Governance- It will also act as a utility token that will allow $CEPH Token holders to vote on governance proposals, like choosing which new revenue services to onboard.","An important distinction to take note of is that even if the $CEPH Token is primarily a utility token, dNFT holders can still profit from it, even with a price-stabilization mechanism.","We designed the $CEPH token to always remain within a predetermined price range so that it stays usable as virtual currency for the Space Station. Tokens that fluctuate (or moon) in price lose out in utility because the services they are used for eventually become too expensive in dollar terms. The solution that satisfies both Cepheus investors and Space Station users is creating a token with some room to grow for price alongside a predetermined price ceiling. The $CEPH price will always fluctuate within a specific price range, so $CEPH will always be usable as currency- without compromising the needs of the people that also want to trade the token.","But we couldn’t call Cepheus dNFT Rewards a “diversified basket of tokens” if we only rewarded dNFT Stakers in the $CEPH token, right?"]}],[{"l":"Yield farming","p":["You receive yield farming rewards automatically by staking your dNFT. It has never been so easy to participate in an ecosystem and get rewarded."]},{"l":"How does it work","p":["Yield farming is one field of DeFi that allows crypto investors to earn rewards by moving their tokens to yield-generating smart contracts. In this process, the investor is the liquidity provider (LP), and the liquidity pool is a cash-filled smart contract.","The yield farming process typically expects participants to lock up or stake their funds, and yield aggregators work by automating the farming process to produce the highest yields possible. Let’s see how this system works in detail.","Yield aggregators combine the investments of various farmers (crypto investors) to facilitate profits earning using different strategies while remaining idle and waiting to accumulate passive income since the automated service provided by yield aggregators does it all for them.","This is how the process looks like: Yield farming Overview","The protocol automatically compounds the rewards from yield aggregators and distributes a portion to the algorithmic trading fund.","Using these strategies, participants can move tokens around different platforms, optimizing yields via auto-compounding. This process allows stakers to claim and restake their rewards without the need to do it manually."]}],[{"l":"Secondary Reward Tokens","p":["The Cepheus Protocol also has the option of partnering with select projects that choose to use the Space Station. Not every project that builds on the Space Station becomes a partner, but the ones that do mutual benefit and grow alongside Cepheus.","Due to these partnerships, Cepheus is able to purchase the tokens of partnered projects at ICO, Seed Round or Private Round Prices. A portion of the tokens from all of these projects also flow into Cepheus dNFTs as secondary rewards, giving Cepheus dNFT holders a well-diversified basket of assets.","If more projects use the Space Station to build, the chances of Cepheus finding suitable protocols to partner with increase. This translates into more secondary rewards for Cepheus dNFT holders in the form of tokens from partnered projects."]}],[{"l":"Angel Investment Fund","p":["Cepheus is a protocol that makes it simple for anyone to deploy Web3 solutions giving it a unique vantage point for spotting new projects that have potential - with a bias towards projects in the NFT niche.","Should a new project prove promising, Cepheus is perfectly positioned to assimilate into its venture portfolio. In return, the protocols funded by Cepheus benefit by being able to access the many Web3 connections brought on by the Space Station - most notably from other companies within the NFT space.","The Angel Investment Fund will give our dNFT holders the ability to steer the ship alongside the protocol once Governance rolls out. The benefits and rewards of the investment fund are split between Sirius and Vega dNFT holders only."]}],[{"l":"Algorithmic Trading Pool","p":["A portion of our Treasury is allocated to our Algorithmic Trading Pool. The trading strategies used in this pool are executed by bots provided by our partners to generate long term, low but stable returns with an emphasis on executing delta-neutral trades (opening long and short positions for the same pair at the same time).

We offer you tools and infrastructure to launch your own dNFT project, within a day."]},{"l":"How does it work","p":["Put simply, a dynamic NFT is an NFT that can change based on external conditions. Change in a dynamic NFT often refers to changes in the NFT’s metadata triggered by a smart contract. This is done by encoding automatic changes within the NFT smart contract, which provides instructions to the underlying NFT regarding when and how its metadata should change.","dNFTs can be upgraded in multiple ways based on external conditions","Dynamic elements besides metadata changes can also exist. For example, dynamic NFTs can be minted based on certain conditions, such as when a hidden spot is found in an augmented reality application. Dynamic NFTs can also house “hidden traits” manifested through user interactions instead of within the metadata. As fully unique and customizable tokens, NFTs can be programmed in an infinite number of ways. However, most dynamic NFTs must implement some form of metadata change in order for non-technical users to “see” the changes."]},{"l":"Infrastructure","p":["We designed an infrastructure that is accessible and easy to use by Web3 projects in any form. The dNFT service can be easily integrated with your existing dApp(s).","We leverage the scalable services from cloud providers, these cloud providers help us scale and deliver high performance loading speed of your dNFTs.

It has never been so easy to deploy dNFTs."]},{"l":"Potential Use Cases","p":["NFT metadata is where the token’s name is specified, traits are assigned, and file links are placed. While the tokenID provides a permanent identifier for verifiable ownership, the metadata is the essence of the NFT—housing the elements that make it useful.","Generative NFT art projects often have a variety of traits, with some rarer than others. These traits are placed within an NFT’s metadata alongside an IPFS link to an image or video that corresponds to the NFT’s traits. In a dNFT, these traits change based on external conditions."]},{"l":"Example use cases","p":["This functionality can be useful for character progression—a core tenet of many different game models—in blockchain games. When first starting a game with a playable NFT character, the NFT has base stats reflected in its metadata. As the player continues leveling up, the metadata in the NFT changes to reflect the character’s growth.","Another case where metadata changes are useful is in the tokenization of virtual assets, where a host of changing metrics are often required. For example, an NFT representing a property could reflect its maintenance history, age, market value, and more. Tokenizing these changing assets therefore requires NFTs which have the ability to update with changing metadata."]}],[{"l":"Space station","p":["Every time a user (or protocol) deploys a new Web3 solution using the Space Station, they pay a platform fee to the Space Station in either stablecoins or $CEPH Tokens.","All of these then go to the Treasury. Cepheus keeps a portion of these Platform Fees as revenue and allocates the remainder to the ADRS, or automated Reward Pool.","Here’s the sequence: Platform Fee (in $CEPH or Stablecoins) ➔ Treasury ➔ Reward Pool (ADRS)","From here, either: A ➔ Liquidity Management Protocol to keep $CEPH Tokens in a certain price range.","Revenue from the Space Station funds the $CEPH Token’s price-stabilization mechanism.

Both tokens allow users to put forward new community-driven proposals - as well as vote for these proposals - for the betterment of their respective protocols.","This is an important step in decentralization and will eventually pivot Cepheus from a team-owned to user-owned protocol. However, it is not necessary to hold $CEPH Tokens to participate in voting because voting power can be allocated from $CEPH token-holders to any wallet address of their choice. This wallet can belong to a person or an application - both of which may be directly involved in Cepheus or not.","Given that application wallets may be granted voting power for Cepheus, the governance system will also play a large part in protocol composability and partnerships.","All proposals are subject to a 6 day voting period. Any address with voting power can vote for or against the proposal. If a majority, and at least 250,000 votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented after 2 days.","In other words, new proposals for Cepheus takes 6 days to vote on, followed by 2 days (at the fastest) to implement, assuming the new proposal passes.","Governance Process","The transition to community governance will be managed with a relentless focus on security & stability, and will follow the principle of increasing decentralization."]}],[{"l":"Contributions","p":["We believe in automated decentralized reward systems (ADRS).
